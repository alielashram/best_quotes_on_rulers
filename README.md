# Best Quotes

This is the "Best Quotes" example application from the book "Rebuilding Rails" by Noah Gibbs. You can find the canonical branch of this framework at "http://github.com/noahgibbs/best_quotes".

It exists to give the framework being built as an alternative to Rails, Rulers, something to serve up.
